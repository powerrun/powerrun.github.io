# Creating Multiple Lists for Cloudflare Zero Trust with Terraform

## Installing Terraform on Windows

First, download the zip package containing Terraform binary from [Terraform Install page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

Once the download is complete, unzip the folder to a location of your choice. To make your life easier to use Terraform from PowerShell, you want to add the folder path that containing Terraform executable to your systemâ€™s Path environment variable. With this setup, you can simply type `terraform` in PowerShell without navigating to the executable folder all the time.
